## Description

While traditional power adapters can provide a variety of current but fixed to 5V output, our RotoPD leverages advanced power delivery protocols to achieve a versatile output range— 3.5V to 30V at 150W max. The breakout board use a stand alone Power Delivery Sink controller to negotiate with your modern charger and provide different output voltage.

Centylab's RotoPD can unlock more advance mode in your USB-C power supplies like Programmable Power Supply (PPS) and Adjustable Voltage Supply (AVS), to provide even more granular voltage adjustment. The RotoPD simplifies power negotiation with USB-C adapters, handling the complex process of establishing power delivery contracts. The controller does all the heavy lifting of power negotiation and provides an easy way to configure over I2C, free your micro-controller from the complicated USB-C PD protocol.

To config the board, you will need an I2C bus. The board integrates seamlessly into the Qwiic and STEMMA QT ecosystems, no soldering is required. We also include an logic level shifter on board to work with **3.3V or 5V I2C system**.

To make it even easier to use, RotoPD includes a built-in buck converter that efficiently steps down USB-C VBUS power to a stable 5V 2A output, making it perfect for powering microcontrollers, sensors, and other low-voltage components in your project.

## Requirements for AVS
To ultilize AVS power profile, you will need a powerbank or charger that has AVS profile and a 240W USB-C cable. Here are some chargers that we found support AVS profile.
